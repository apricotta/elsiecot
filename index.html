<h1>what's she like?</h1>

“Curious” is an understatement when it comes to describing Elsie’s personality. She's spunky, eager, and ready to take on challenges. She possesses a powerful drive for discovery, as she holds no greater joy than in getting her hands dirty to pull things apart and put them back together better than they were before. <p> Despite her mechanical tendencies, she’s quite puzzling: she’s friendly but has a difficult time creating intimate bonds, she’s settled and forthright yet vociferous and bounces off the walls once her creative energy blossoms, and she’s terribly stubborn yet constantly eager to gain more perspective. <p> Not only is she driven by discovery, but morality as well: through her occupation, she has grown to highly value ethics and a “do unto others” approach to life. However, her sense of practical realism can lead her to be a bit naïve at times, especially when it comes to emotional situations. <p> Thanks to her moderately privileged and untroubled upbringing, Elsie longs to understand the struggles of others in order to gain more perspective and improve her abilities of empathy and helping others. She tends to put her needs and struggles below those of others due to her affluent childhood.<p>

#STORYTIME<p>
    
Contrary to the typical protagonist archetype, Elsie did not grow up with a shattered childhood. Her mother, an enchanting blacksmith, and her father, an inventor, poured knowledge into Elsie as she grew up, and continue to do so to this day. Her mother taught her how to work with metals and skills in weapon forgery, while her father taught her mechanics and engineering. <p> 
The only traumatic experience of her childhood occurred at the age of 12. A vehement case of sepsis produced tissue necrosis of her lower legs—from just above her knee all the way down--beyond repair, resulting in the requirement of amputation in order to prevent the infection from spreading further--the case being so violent and persistent that the only Faith magic available at the time could not remove the infection (the somewhat remote location of Elsie's hometown caused healing resources to be limited, and time was another limiting factor), leaving amputation as the best option.<p> As plans to contact a higher-level Faith magic user were made in order to regenerate Elsie's legs, Elsie was accidentally exposed to a rare environmental source of magic which inhibits the use of Faith magic, causing Elsie's amputations to be permanent.<p>

In spite of the unfortunate result of her amputations, Elise looked on the bright side, leading to her venture into the world of prosthetics. With the help of her parents, she had constructed her own artificial limbs by the age of 14. Over the years, Elsie has tinkered with her legs, adding helpful gadgets such as tools while maintaining kinesthetic function with her engineering knowledge. She is praised and revered in her hometown for her craftmanship skills, but there's a certain skill in particular that Elsie fails to get a grasp of: magic. <p> For years upon years, Elsie's parents have tried to teach Elsie how to use magic, but to no avail. Even something as simple as a Mana Spark always seems to result in disaster: breaking vases, wreaking havoc, and even turning her father's skin green (fortunately, the horrid color faded after awhile). Elsie's ability to excel in mechanics/blacksmithing and inability to do so in magic makes her all the more frustrated with herself. A mechanical genius but a magical dunce...what to do? <p>

Due to her lack of magic skill, Elsie decided to send in an application to Ulreich University (and was somehow accepted despite her dreadful magical ability at the time). She dreamed of harnessing the power of magic, and Ulreich University seemed to be the best option, or else she'd have to travel across the world just to learn. Elsie aspires to pursue the tree of Geomancy, aiming to first learn how to harness the power of earth and metal--or essentially the materials she's learned to make weapons and other crafts out of all these years.<p> Her long-term goal is to pursue the field of Enchantment once she conquers Geomancy and becomes skilled enough to pursue two magic trees. She plans on using her Enchantment ability to enchant the weapons she makes out of earth with her Geomancy; this is her overarching goal, but she may learn several other skills within these trees along her educational journey. <p> Once accepted, Elsie was wary of missing her cozy home life with her blacksmithing mother and engineering father, but she was more than ready to journey off to accomplish her dream of becoming a wielder of magic!

<h1>What she do?</h1>

Universal Spells: <p>

1. Mana Weave - The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana. <p>

2. Mana Spark - A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh. <p>

<p> Geomancy <strike> n00b </strike>Paige Spells: <p>

1. "Instrumenta Terrae"/Earthen Hardware I - Elsie can create a standard 11 in. hammer from earth using her magic. The hammer is telekinetically controlled and can be used for convinience within the workshop setting, or it can be "flung" at enemies to a small extent within a combat scenario. At Paige rank, the hammer posseses a durability level equivalent to tin. The strength at which the hammer is thrown at this rank is similar to the power of average human arms, and it cannot be controlled beyond 5 ft. of her person as a Paige spell. Creating the hammer itself requires a flat rate of mana, while controlling it gradually drains mana. The durability, or "toughness" of the hammer scales up passively as Elsie grows in skill until Mage, when an iron level hammer durability will be acquired. <p>

2. "Paries Terrae"/Wall of Earth I - A wall of earth about 3 ft tall and 4 ft wide that acts as defense, summoned from the earth via Geomancy. Elsie must crouch behind the wall in order to defend herself, and the wall is temporary and can be penetrated and/or destroyed after a certain number of attacks, depending on the strength of such attacks; the durability of the wall is equivalent to tin at Paige rank and scales up in strength naturally until iron level durability is acquired at Mage rank. The wall can be created no more than 1 foot in front of where she stands. <p>

3. "Iactare Petram"/Rock Throw I - A cluster of rocks or pebbles, either created from the earth using magic or simply summoned from the surface of the earth if they can naturally be found in the scenario environment, can be launched at an opponent as an attack. The size of the rock cluster is equivalent to the size of an average human fist at Paige rank, can only be fired in a single, linear direction, and the cluster can only be sent a maximum of 15 ft. from wherever Elsie stands. The rocks are launched at a moderate speed, but move slightly faster if the rocks are found naturally within the ambient environment. The "toughness" level of the rocks is tin at Paige rank, then progress in strength with each increasing rank until Mage rank, where an iron toughness level will be acquired. <p>

p.s. the mentioning the tin toughness level/progression to iron and whatnot may seem redundant, but it's mostly for my own convinience :p <p>

p.p.s. shouting "rOcK tHrOw" or "waLL oF EaRTh" at an opponent is p lame, hence the Latin :^) <p>


<p>Weapons:<p>

1. In her mechanical legs, she has iron durability tool attachments that she uses for her engineering work that could be used as weapons with her hands. At Paige level, however, she does not have the ability to handle metal with magic, so she can not "levitate" or use magic with these tools. She can only use them by hand.<p>
<p> -Hammer <p> -Wrenches (adjustable x1, crescent x1, hexagonal x5) <p> -Screwdrivers (varied; x4) <p> -2 in. whittlin' knife <p> -Pliers <p> -Measurement Tape <p>
